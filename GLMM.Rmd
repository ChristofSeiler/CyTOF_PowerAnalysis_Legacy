## Goal

Power is the probability that an estimated treatment effect is statistically significantly positive. The goal is to evaluate power as a function of the number of donors using simulated fake-data. Based on our assumptions, we setup a model, generate fake data, and set paramters. The paramters are taken from the Angelo et al. 2015[^1].

## Generate Fake Data

```{r}
n_cell = 10000
n_LTNP = 30
n_CP = 30

```

## Fit Model and Calculate Power

```{r}

```
